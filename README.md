Hello, I present to your attention the "Best Chat Of The World", 
developed by me during my studies. This file contains instructions on how to use it.

1. First you need to start Chat Server(This can be checked in the task manager Ctrl+Alt+Delete. 
   You can see "Java(TM) Platform SE binary"). Files "baseforchat", "logging" and folder "logs" must be in the same directory as "Chat Server" 

2. Start Chat Client. Folder "history" must be in the same directory as "Chat Client" 

3. Registration. Make a registration if you have not registered. Press "reg". Enter your login, password, nickname and server's IP Address
   (Enter "localhost", when Server and Client are on same Computer). 

4. Authentication. Enter your login and password. Enter your server's IP Address. 
   (Enter "localhost", when Server and Client are on same Computer). Press "auth"

5. Commands: 
	"/w name message" - send a message, where "name" is user's name and "message" is your text 
	(you can also press user's name on rightside and write your message)
	"/end" - exit from chat
	"/cn name" - change nickname, where "name" is new nickname
	"/clientlist" - show you all users of chat

6. To shut down the server you need to open the task manager, find "Java(TM) Platform SE binary" and end the process
